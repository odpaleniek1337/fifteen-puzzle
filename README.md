Repository contains implementation of exemplary fifteen-puzzle solving techniques

![Tests](https://github.com/odpaleniek1337/radio-generator/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Implemented algorithms


## Additional information
Heuristic algorithms were optimized by adding hashes of previously visited nodes, so if a new node would be exactly the same it won't be added as a state to check

Developed using `Python 3.8.10` and tested with the use of `pytest`  and checked linting with the use of `flake8`
